# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction App

This is my internship project developed as part of the AI & ML Internship Program by Edunet Foundation in collaboration with IBM.

The project is a simple yet effective Streamlit web application that predicts crop yields based on environmental and agricultural data using a Random Forest Regression model.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User inputs parameters like location, crop, season, area, rainfall, etc.  
2. The app uses a Random Forest model trained on historical crop data.  
3. It predicts the expected crop yield based on the inputs.  
4. Visualizations and performance metrics are shown for better insights.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Add support for more input features (soil type, temperature, humidity)  
- Enable uploading custom datasets for prediction  
- Implement different model choices (Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting)  
- Add option to export prediction results as CSV
